            <p>
                A project is a big responsibility, but you can make it easier to handle by planning it out in advance. This is done by <b>identifying</b> your project's <b>goals</b> and breaking them down into <b>actionable steps</b>. While staying aware of any budget or time constraints, you'll need to adjust your plans as the project takes shape. Then, by communicating with the project members, you'll manage the project to success.
